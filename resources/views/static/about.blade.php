<p>Hi my name is <b>Jorge Murta,</b></p>

<p>I made this project to be an example of a start of an application in Laravel 5.1. In this project you can see an example implementation of the <b>Repository Pattern</b>, with <b>Dependency Injection</b>.</p>

<p>A system that can update other clients when a new contact is added via <b>WebSockets</b> using the <b>Pusher Service API</b> and a small implementation of the <b>Knockout Framework</b> in the middle of this real-time updates.
</p>

<p>To design this project I used the new <b>Google Design Specification</b> (called <i><b><a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Material Design</a></b></i>) by adding Bootstrap and <b><a href="https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design">FezVrasta Material Design Git Repository</a></b>.</p>

<p>This project use <b>Controllers</b>, <b>Routing</b>, <b>Migrations</b>, <b>Seeds</b>, and other <i><b>Laravel and MVC tools</b></i>. I use <b>Laravel</b> for 3 years now and I recommend it for your daily work. You can read and learn more about the framework at it's official website <b><a href="http://laravel.com/">http://laravel.com</a></b> and on <b><a href="https://laracasts.com/">Laracasts</a></b> which is a virtual school owned by Jeffrey Way (one of the pioneers of the framework). This virtual school is awesome for both beginners and advanced Laravel Developers.</p>
